# Continuous Probability Distributions

```{r, include=FALSE}
library("mosaic")
library("NHANES")
```

Chapter 5 dealt with probability distributions arising from discrete random variables. Mostly that chapter focused on the binomial experiment. There are many other experiments from discrete random variables that exist but are not covered in this book.

Chapter 6 deals with probability distributions that arise from continuous random variables. The focus of this chapter is a distribution known as the normal distribution, though realize that there are many other distributions that exist. A few others are examined in future chapters.

Looking at the density plot of a quantitative variable, one can guess what the distribution of that variable is. As an example, consider the NHANES data frame. One variable to consider is Weight. The density plot of Weight is

**Graph 6.1: Density Plot of Weight of a Person**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gf_density(~Weight, data=NHANES)
```

This graph looks somewhat symmetric, and maybe bell shaped.

Consider, the variable head circumference (HeadCirc) in the NHANES data frame. The density plot for this variable is

**Graph 6.2: Density Plot of Head Circumference of a Person**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gf_density(~HeadCirc, data=NHANES)
```

This graph looks somewhat skewed left.

Now consider the variable BMI from the NHANES data frame. The density plot is

**Graph 6.3: Density Plot of BMI of a Person**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gf_density(~BMI, data=NHANES)
```

This density plot appears to be skewed left.

Now consider the variable SmokeAge. Its density plot is

**Graph 6.4: Density Plot of Age when Person Started Smoking**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES)
```

This distribution appears to be bimodal.

lastly, consider the variable Pulse. The density plot is

**Graph 6.5: Density Plot of Pulse Rate of a person**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
gf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES)
```

This density plot appears to be symmetric and could almost be considered bell shaped. 

The reason that one considers the density plots to understand the distribution of the population, is that in some cases the distribution can be approximated with a known distribution that has certain properties. There are many known distribution. Some examples are the Uniform distribution, the Chi-Squared distribution, the Student's T distribution, and the normal distribution. The normal distribution is one of the more common distributions to use as a model, and it will be explored in this chapter. But do realize that there are many other distributions that one can use.

** Normal Distribution **

>Many populations have a distribution that is a symmetric, unimodal, and bell-shaped. For example: height, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. However, not every bell shaped curve is a normal curve. In a normal curve, there is a specific relationship between its "height" and its "width."
>Normal curves can be tall and skinny or they can be short and fat. They are all symmetric, unimodal, and centered at $\mu$, the population mean. Graph \#6.6 shows two different normal curves drawn on the same scale. Both have $\mu=2$ but the one in Graph \#5.6a has a standard deviation of 1 and the one in Graph \#6.5b has a standard deviation of 4. Notice that the larger standard deviation makes the graph wider (more spread out) and shorter.

**Graph \#6.6a: Normal Distribution Graph with $\mu=2$, and $\sigma=1$**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cord.x <- c(-2, seq(-2, 7, .1),-1) 
cord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-2, 7, .1), 2, 1),0) 
curve(dnorm(x, 2, 1),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4)) 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y)
```

**Graph \#6.6b: Normal Distribution Graph with $\mu = 2$, and $\sigma = 4$**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cord.x <- c(-10, seq(-10, 15, .1),-1) 
cord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(-10, 15, .1), 2, 4),0) 
curve(dnorm(x, 2, 4),xlim=c(2-3*4,2+3*4), ylim=c(0,0.4)) 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y)
```

>Every normal curve has common features.
>
-   The center, or the highest point, is at the population mean, $\mu$.
-   The transition points are the places where the curve changes from a "hill" to a "valley". The distance from the mean to the transition point is one standard deviation, .
-   The area under the whole curve is exactly 1. Therefore, the area under the half below or above the mean is 0.5.

>Just as in a discrete probability distribution, the object is to find the probability of an event occurring. However, unlike in a discrete probability distribution where the event can be a single value, in a continuous probability distribution the event must be a range. You are interested in finding the probability of *x* occurring in the range between *a* and *b*, or $P(a \le x \le b) = P(a<x<b)$. Calculus tells us this probability is the area under the curve in the interval from *a* to *b*.

**\
**

>Before looking at the process for finding the probabilities under the normal curve, it is somewhat useful to look at the **Empirical Rule** that gives approximate values for these areas. The Empirical Rule is just an approximation and it will only be used in this section to give you an idea of what the size of the probabilities is for different shadings. A more precise method for finding probabilities for the normal curve will be demonstrated in the next section. Please do not use the
empirical rule except for real rough estimates.

>**The Empirical Rule** for any normal distribution:
Approximately 68% of the data is within one standard deviation of the
mean.
Approximately 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the
mean.
Approximately 99.7% of the data is within three standard deviations of
the mean.

**

**Graph \#6.7: Empirical Rule**

![Graph of Empirical Rule](Empirical_rule.png)

Be careful, there is still some area left over in each end. Remember,
the maximum a probability can be is 100%, so if you calculate you will
see that for both ends together there is 0.3% of the curve. Because of
symmetry, you can divide this equally between both ends and find that
there is 0.15% in each tail beyond the .

## Finding Probabilities for the Normal Distribution

The Empirical Rule is just an approximation and only works for certain values. What if you want to find the probability for *x* values that are not integer multiples of the standard deviation? The probability is the area under the curve. To find areas under the curve, you need calculus. Before technology, you needed to convert every *x* value to a standardized number, called the *z*-score or *z-*value or simply just *z*. The *z*-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an *x* value is from the mean. To convert from a normally distributed *x* value to a *z*-score, you use the following formula.

***z*-score**
$=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$

where $\mu$ = mean of the population of the *x* value and $\sigma$ = standard deviation for the population of the *x* value

The *z*-score is normally distributed, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is known as the standard normal curve. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations a data value is from its mean. If the z-score is positive, the data value is above the mean. If the z-score is negative, the data value is below the mean. The farther the z-value is from 0, the farther the data value is from the mean. 

These days technology can find probabilities without converting to the *z*-score and looking the probabilities up in a table. There are many programs available that will calculate the probability for a normal curve. The command on R to find the area to the left is $P(x<value)$=pnorm(value, mean, standard deviation, lower.tail=TRUE). The command on R to find the area to the right is $P(x>value)$=pnorm(value, mean, standard deviation, lower.tail=FALSE).

### Example: General Normal Distribution**

> The length of a human pregnancy is normally distributed with a mean of 272 days with a standard deviation of 9 days (Bhat & Kushtagi, 2006).

a.  State the random variable.

> **Solution:**
>
> *x* = length of a human pregnancy

b.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting more than 280 days.

> **Solution:**
>
> First translate the statement into a mathematical statement. $P(x>280)$
>
> Now, draw a picture.

**Graph \#6.1.1: Normal Distribution Graph for $P(x>280)$**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cord.x <- c(280,seq(280,340,0.01),340) 
cord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(280,340,0.01),272,9),0) 
curve(dnorm(x,272,9),xlim=c(230,320),main= "Pregnancy Length ") 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='skyblue')
```

The probability of a pregnancy lasting longer than 280 days is $P(x>280)=0.187$. The command in R Studio is

```{r}
pnorm(280, 272, 9, lower.tail=FALSE)
```
>
> Thus 18.7% of all pregnancies last more than 280 days. This is not
> unusual since the probability is greater than 5%.

c.  Find the probability of a pregnancy lasting less than 250 days.

> **Solution:**
>
> First translate the statement into a mathematical statement. $P(x<250)$
>
> Now, draw a picture. 

**Graph \#6.1.2: Normal Distribution Graph for $P(x<250)$**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cord.x <- c(150,seq(150,250,0.01),250) 
cord.y <- c(0,dnorm(seq(150,250,0.01),272,9),0) 
curve(dnorm(x,272,9),xlim=c(230,320),main= "Pregnancy Length ") 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='skyblue')
```

The probability of a pregnancy lasting longer than 250 days is $P(x<250)=0.0073$. The command in R Studio is

```{r}
pnorm(250, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE)
```
>
> Thus 0.73% of all pregnancies last less than 250 days. This is unusual
> since the probability is less than 5%.

d.  Find the probability that a pregnancy lasts between 265 and 280
    days.

> **Solution:**

>**Graph \#6.1.3: Normal Distribution Graph for $P(265<x<280)$**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cord.x <- c(265,seq(265,280,0.01),280)

curve(dnorm(x,272,9),xlim=c(230,320),main= "Pregnancy Length") 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='skyblue')
```

The probability of a pregnancy lasting between 265 days and 280 days is $P(265<x<280)=0.187$. To find the area between two values on the normal distribution, first, find the area to the left of the lower value, Graphically, this looks like

curve(dnorm(x,272,9),xlim=c(230,320),main= "Pregnancy Length ") 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='blue')
```

>Looking at the three graphs, if you take the area in Graph \#6.1.5 and subtract the area in Graph \#6.1.4, you get the area in the Graph \#6.1.3. In R Studio, the way to find the probability the probability of a pregnancy lasting between 265 days and 280 days, $P(265<x<280)=0.595$ use the following command 

```{r}
pnorm(280, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE)-pnorm(265, 272, 9, lower.tail=TRUE)
```
>
> Thus 59.5% of all pregnancies last between 265 and 280 days.

e.  Find the length of pregnancy that 10% of all pregnancies last less than.

> **Solution:**
>
> This problem is asking you to find an *x* value from a probability.
> You want to find the *x* value that has 10% of the length of pregnancies to the left of it. In this case, you are given the probability. In R, the command is qnorm(area, mean, standard deviation, lower.tail=TRUE or FALSE). For this example since you know the area in the lower tail, then use lower.tail=TRUE. So the command is

```{r}
qnorm(0.1, 272, 9, lower.tail = TRUE)
```
>
> Thus 10% of all pregnancies last less than approximately 260 days.

f.  Suppose you meet a woman who says that she was pregnant for less
    than 250 days. Would this be unusual and what might you think?

> **Solution:**
>
> From part (c) you found the probability that a pregnancy lasts less than 250 days is 0.73%. Since this is less than 5%, it is very unusual. You would think that either the woman had a premature baby, or that she may be wrong about when she actually became pregnant.

### Example: General Normal Distribution**

b.  Find the probability that a person has a mathematics SAT score
    over 700.

curve(dnorm(x,514,117),xlim=c(100,1100),main= "SAT Mathematics Score ") 
polygon(cord.x,cord.y,col='skyblue')

To find $P(x>700)=0.0559$, the command in R would be

```{r}
pnorm(700, 514,117, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Assessing Normality

The distributions you have seen up to this point have been assumed to be normally distributed, but how do you determine if it is normally distributed. One way is to take a sample and look at the sample to determine if it appears normal. If the sample looks normal, then most likely the population is also. Here are some guidelines that are use to help make that determination.

1.  **Density Plot:** Make a density plot. For a normal distribution, the density plot should be roughly bell-shaped. For small samples, this is not very accurate, and another method is needed. A distribution may not look normally distributed from the density plot, but it still may be normally distributed.

2.  **Normal quantile plot (or normal probability plot):** This plot is provided through statistical software on a computer. If the points lie close to a line, the data comes from a distribution that is approximately normally distributed. If the points do not lie close to a line or they show a pattern that is not a line, the data are likely to come from a distribution that is not normally distributed.

> **To create a density plot on R Studio:**
>
> Read the Data Frame into R Studio. The command for density is gf_density(~variable, data=Data Frame). See section 2.2 for more examples of this..
>
> **To create a normal quantile plot on R Studio:**
>
> Read the Data Frame into R Studio. The command for normal quantile plot is gf_qqnorm(~variable, data=Data Frame). 

Realize that your random variable may be normally distributed, even if the sample fails the two tests. However, if the density plot definitely doesn't look symmetric and bell shaped, and the normal probability plot doesn't look linear, then you can be fairly confident that the data set does not come from a population that is normally distributed.

### Example: Is It Normal?**

In Kiama, NSW, Australia, there is a blowhole. The data in table \#6.2.1 are times in seconds between eruptions (\"Kiama blowhole eruptions,\" 2013). Do the data come from a population that is normally distributed?

## Sampling Distribution and the Central Limit Theorem

You now have most of the skills to start statistical inference, but you need one more concept.

First, it would be helpful to state what statistical inference is in more accurate terms.

**Statistical Inference:** to make accurate decisions about parameters from statistics

When it says "accurate decision," you want to be able to measure how accurate. You measure how accurate using probability. In both binomial and normal distributions, you needed to know that the random variable followed either distribution. You need to know how the statistic is distributed and then you can find probabilities. In other words, you need to know the shape of the sample mean or whatever statistic you want to make a decision about.

How is the statistic distributed? This is answered with a sampling distribution.

**Sampling Distribution:** how a sample statistic is distributed when repeated trials of size *n* are taken.

### Example: Sampling Distribution**

> The NHANES data frame has the pusle rates for approximately 50,000 individuals. The random variable is *x* = pusle rate. The probability distribution of this random variable is presented in Graph \#6.3.1. Although pulse rates from 50,000 individuals isn't the entire population, the sample is most likely a good representation of the population. Thus, it is safe to assume the population is normally distributed. An estimate for the population mean is 73.6 pbm, and the population standard deviation estimated at is 12.2 bpm. 
>
> **Graph \#6.3.1: Distribution of Pulse Rate**

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gf_density(~Pulse, data=NHANES)
df_stats(~Pulse, data=NHANES, mean, sd)
```

> Suppose you take a random sample of 10 pusle rates from those 50,000 individuals. A random sample of data from 10 individuals is:

```{r}
NHANES%>%
  sample_n(size=10)
```

It might be useful to find the mean pulse rate from a random sample of size 10.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
NHANES%>%
  sample_n(size=10)%>%
  df_stats(~Pulse, mean)
```

> Now suppose you took another random sample of size 10 and found the mean pulse rate for that sample. Repeat this process 100 times. At this point you would basically have a new sample of 100 mean pulse rates. You could assess how this sample is distributed by creating a density plot.

> **Graph \#6.3.2: Density Plot of Sample Means When *n* = 10**


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Trials <- 
  do(100) * {
    NHANES %>%
      sample_n(size = 10) %>%
      df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean)
  }

gf_density( ~means, data = Trials)

df_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd)
```

> This distribution is a sampling distribution. That is all a sampling distribution is. It is a  distribution created from statistics.
>
> Notice the distribution does look a great deal like the distribution of the original random variable. Notice the mean of the sample means $\mu_{\bar{x}} = 73.8$ bpm which is almost the same of as the mean of the population. The standard deviation of the sample means, $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=4.35$ pbm is about $\frac{1}{3}$ of the population standard deviation. 
>
> What does this distribution look like if instead of repeating the experiment 10 times you repeat it 50 times instead?
>
> This density plot of the sampling distribution is displayed in Graph \#6.3.3.
>
> **Graph \#6.3.3: Density Plot of Sample Means When *n* = 50**

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Trials <- 
  do(100) * {
    NHANES %>%
      sample_n(size = 50) %>%
      df_stats( ~Pulse, means = mean)
  }

gf_density( ~means, data = Trials)%>%
  gf_lims(x=c(68,79))

df_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd)
```
>
> Notice this density plot of the sample mean looks approximately symmetrical and could almost be called normal. Notice, the mean of the sample means is 73.6 bpm which is approximately what the population mean is. The standard deviation of the sample means is 1.77 bpm which is around $\frac{1}{7}$ of the population standard deviation.  What if you keep increasing *n*? What will the sampling distribution of the sample mean look like? In other words, what does the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ look like as *n* gets even larger?

This depends on how the original distribution is distributed. In Example \#6.3.1, the random variable was approximately normally distributed. When *n* was 10, the distribution of the mean looked approximately normal. What if the original distribution wasn't normal? How big would *n* have to be? Consider a different variable in the NHANES data frame that isn't normally distributed such as age when a participant started to smoke cigarettes (SmokeAge). The density plot for the large sample is in Graph 6.3.3. The mean for the large sample is 17.8 years and the standard deviation is 5.3 years, so $\mu=$17.8$ and $\sigma=5.3$ approximately.

> **Graph \#6.3.4: Distribution of Age when Started to Smoke**

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gf_density(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES)
df_stats(~SmokeAge, data=NHANES, mean, sd)
```

Now take 100 samples of size 50 individuals from the NHANES Data Frame. Then graph a density plot of SmokeAge. Notice the the sampling distribution of the sample means looks fairly normally distributed even though the original random variable was not normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean. $\mu_{ \bar{x}}=$ 17.8 years and the standard deviation of the sample mean,  $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=$ 1.56 years. The mean of the sample mean is the same as the mean of the population, but the standard deviation of the sample mean is much less than the standard deviation of the original data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Trials <- 
  do(100) * {
    NHANES %>%
      sample_n(size = 50) %>%
      df_stats( ~SmokeAge, means = mean)
  }

gf_density( ~means, data = Trials)%>%
  gf_lims(x=c(13,24))

df_stats(~means, data=Trials, mean, sd)
```
  
Once question is, why is the mean of the sample means the same as the mean of the population? Suppose you have a random variable that has a population mean, $\mu$, and a population standard deviation, $\sigma$. If a sample of size *n* is taken, then the sample mean, has a mean $\mu_{ \bar{x}}=\mu$ and standard deviation of $\sigma_{ \bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ . The standard deviation of the sample mean is lower because by taking the mean you are averaging out the extreme values, which makes the distribution of the sample mean less spread out.

You now know the center and the variability of $\bar{x}$. You also want to know the shape of the distribution of $\bar{x}$. You hope it is normal, since you know how to find probabilities using the normal curve. The following theorem tells you the requirement to have $\bar{x}$ be normally distributed.

**Theorem \#6.3.1: Central Limit Theorem.**

Suppose a random variable is from any distribution. If a sample of size *n* is taken, then the sample mean, $\bar{x}$, becomes normally distributed as *n* increases.

What this says is that no matter what *x* looks like, $\bar{x}$ would look normal if *n* is large enough. Now, what size of *n* is large enough? That depends on how *x* is distributed in the first place. If the original random variable is normally distributed, then *n* just needs to be 2 or
more data points. If the original random variable is somewhat mound shaped and symmetrical, then *n* needs to be greater than or equal to 30. Sometimes the sample size can be smaller, but this is a good general rule to use. The sample size may have to be much larger if the original random variable is really skewed one way or another.

Now that you know when the sample mean will look like a normal distribution, then you can find the probability related to the sample mean. Remember that the mean of the sample mean is just the mean of the original data ($\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu$), but the standard deviation of the sample mean, $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$, also known as the standard error of the mean, is actually $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. Make sure you use this in all calculations. If you are using the *z*-score, the formula when working with $\bar{x}$ is $z=\frac{x-\mu_{\bar{x}}}{\sigma_{\bar{x}}}=\frac{x-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$. 
To use R Studio to calculate probabilities use
$P(\bar{x}<a)= pnorm(a, \mu_{\bar{x}}, \sigma_{\bar{x}}, lower.tail=TRUE)$
$P(\bar{x}>a)= pnorm(a, \mu_{\bar{x}}, \sigma_{\bar{x}}, lower.tail=FALSE)$.

### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means**

The birth weight of boy babies of European descent who were delivered at 40 weeks is normally distributed with a mean of 3687.6 g with a standard deviation of 410.5 g (Janssen, Thiessen, Klein, Whitfield, MacNab & Cullis-Kuhl, 2007). Suppose there were nine European descent boy babies born on a given day and the mean birth weight is calculated.

a.  State the random variable.

> **Solution:**
>
> *x* = birth weight of boy babies (Note: the random variable is something you measure, and it is not the mean birth weight. Mean weight is calculated.)

b.  What is the mean of the sample mean?

> **Solution:**
> $\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu=3687.4g$

c.  What is the standard deviation of the sample mean?

> **Solution:**
> $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{410.5g}{\sqrt{9}}=136.8g$

d.  What distribution is the sample mean distributed as?

> **Solution:**
>
> Since the original random variable is distributed normally, then the sample mean is distributed normally.

e.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine boy babies born was less than 3500.4 g.

> **Solution:**
>
> To find $P(\bar{x}<3500.4)=0.086$. use the R Studio command

```{r}
pnorm(3500.4,3687.6, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)
```

>
> There is an 8.6% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3500.4 g. Since this is more than 5%, this is not unusual.

f.  Find the probability that the mean weight of the nine babies born was less than 3452.5 g.

> **Solution:**
>
> You are looking for the $P(\bar{x}<3452.5)$.
>
> To find in R Studio, $P(\bar{x}<3452.5)=0.043$ use the command

```{r}
pnorm(3452.5, 3687.4, 410.5/sqrt(9), lower.tail = TRUE)
```
>
> There is a 4.3% chance that the mean birth weight of the nine boy babies born would be less than 3452.5 g. Since this is less than 5% this would be an unusual event. If it actually happened, then you may think there is something unusual about this sample. Maybe some of the nine babies were born as multiples, which brings the mean weight down, or some or all of the babies were not of European descent (in fact the mean weight of South Asian boy babies is 3452.5 g), or some were born before 40 weeks, or the babies were born at high altitudes.

### Example: Finding Probabilities for Sample Means**

For Americans that smoke, the average age that they started smoking is 17.8 years, with a standard deviation of approximately 1.56 years from the NHANES data. This random variable is not normally distributed, though it is somewhat mound shaped.

a.  State the random variable.

> **Solution:**
>
> *x* = age that smoking Americans started to smoke

b.  Suppose a sample of 35 smoking American's is taken. Find the probability that the mean age that these 35 smoking Americans started to smoke is more than 21 years.

> **Solution:**
>
> Even though the original random variable is not normally distributed, the sample size is over 30, by the central limit theorem the sample mean will be normally distributed. The mean of the sample mean is $\mu_{\bar{x}}=17.8$. The standard deviation of the sample mean is $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=\frac{1.56}{\sqrt{35}}$. You have all the information you need to use the normal command using R Studio. Without the central limit theorem, you couldn't use the normal command, and you would not be able to answer this question.
>
> The probability that the mean age that 35 smoking Americans start to smoke is more than 21 years, is the mathematical statement $P(\bar{x}>21)$
> 
> To find $P(\bar{x}>21)= 3.42X10^{-34}$ using R studio, use the command:

```{r}
pnorm(21, 17.8, 1.56/sqrt(35), lower.tail=FALSE)
```
>
> The probability of a sample mean of 35 smoking Americans being more than 21 years when they smoked for the first time is very small. This is extremely unlikely to happen. If it does, it may make you wonder about the sample. Could the population mean have increased from the 17.8 years as was stated? Could the sample not have been random, and instead have been a group of smoking Americans who had started to smoke much later? These questions, and more, are ones that you would want to ask as a researcher
