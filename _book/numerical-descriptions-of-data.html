<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Numerical Descriptions of Data</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 1 discussed what a population, sample, parameter, and statistic are, and how to take different types of samples. Chapter 2 discussed ways to graphically display data. There was also a discussion of important characteristics: center, variations, distribution, outliers, and changing characteristics of the data over time. Distributions and outliers can be answered using graphical means. Finding the center and variation can be done using numerical methods that will be discussed in this chapter. Both graphical and numerical methods are part of a branch of statistics known as <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Later descriptive statistics will be used to make decisions and/or estimate population parameters using methods that are part of the branch called <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.</p>

<div id="measures-of-center" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Measures of Center</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section focuses on measures of central tendency. Many times you are asking what to expect on average. Such as when you pick a major, you would probably ask how much you expect to earn in that field. If you are thinking of relocating to a new town, you might ask how much you can expect to pay for housing. If you are planting vegetables in the spring, you might want to know how long it will be until you can harvest. These questions, and many more, can be answered by knowing the center of the data set. There are three measures of the “center” of the data. They are the mode, median, and mean. Any of the values can be referred to as the “average.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>mode</strong> is the data value that occurs the most frequently in the data. To find it, you count how often each data value occurs, and then determine which data value occurs most often. The mode is not the most useful measure of center. This is because, a data set can have more than one mode. If there is a tie between two values for the most number of times then both values are the mode and the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point occurs the same number of times, there is no mode. If there are more than two numbers that appear the most times, then usually there is no mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>median</strong> is the data value in the middle of a sorted list of data. To find it, you put the data in order, and then determine which data value is in the middle of the data set.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>mean</strong> is the arithmetic average of the numbers. This is the center that most people call the average, though all three – mean, median, and mode – really are averages.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no symbols for the mode and the median, but the mean is used a great deal, and statisticians gave it a symbol. There are actually two symbols, one for the population parameter and one for the sample statistic. In most cases you cannot find the population parameter, so you use the sample statistic to estimate the population parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Population Mean:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, pronounced mu</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>N</em> is the size of the population.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>x</em> represents a data value.</p>

<p>Looking at the data frame for cats weights table(#3.1.1), you see that there are several variables You may want to know what the other variables are. A * Code Book * describes the data set, explains what the variables are including the units, and the source of the data frame. To review the code book for a data frame, complete the following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">??cats</code></pre></div>
<p>Then click on MASS::cats. The output looks like:</p>
<p><strong>Figure #3.1.1: Code book for cats data frame</strong> <img src="code_book_cats.jpeg" alt="Code book for cats data" /></p>
<p>Suppose you want to know if male cats weight more than female cats. Looking at the variables, you notice that there is a variable for the sex of the cat. You can look at the weights of males and females separately. This looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> To find the mean and median, separated by sex, use this command in R Studio:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">df_stats</span>(Bwt<span class="op">~</span>Sex, <span class="dt">data=</span>cats, mean, median)</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice that the female cats’ mean weigh 2.4 kg and the male cats’ mean weigh 2.9 kg The median weight of female cats is 2.3 kg and for males is is 2.9 kg So it does appear that males cats weight a bit more than the female cats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many different summary statistics that can be found. An example is the minimum and maximum value. In this example, you will see how to find the min and max values and then filter them out of a data set to see what effect they have on the mean and median.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong> The command in R Studio for finding the minimum and maximum is very simliar to how to find the mean and median, In fact all summary statistics start with df_stats(~variable, data=Data Frame, desired statistics).

<p>Now create two new datasets. One data set will exclude the maximum value. You can call it anything you want, but it would make sense to call it something like nomax. The command to create the new data set is:</p>

<p>The &lt;- is the way to indicate to R what the data set nomin is equivalent to what follows the symbol. Notice that it doesn’t look like anything hapened, but new datsets were created in the background. Now you can find the mean and median of each new data set:</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">df_stats</span>(<span class="op">~</span>Bwt, <span class="dt">data=</span>nomax, mean, median)</code></pre></div>

## 1  2.74964        2.7</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The mean without the minimum value is 2.75 kg, and the median is 2.7 kg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Example 3.1.1, the mean of the data set with all the values is 2.72 kg where the median is 2.7 kg. Notice that when the maximum value was excluded from the data set, the mean decreased a little but the median didn’t change, and when the minimum value was excluded from the data set, the mean increased a little but the median didn’t change. The mean is much higher than the median. Why is this? This is because the mean is affected by extreme values, while the median is not. We say the median is a much more resistant measure of center because it isn’t affected by extreme values as much.</p>
<p>An outlier is a data value that is very different from the rest of the data. It can be really high or really low. Extreme values may be an outlier if the extreme value is far enough from the center. If there are extreme values in the data, the median is a better measure of the center than the mean. If there are no extreme values, the mean and the median will be similar so most people use the mean. The mean is not a resistant measure because it is affected by extreme values. The median is a resistant measure because it not affected by extreme values.</p>
<p>As a consumer you need to be aware that people choose the measure of center that best supports their claim. When you read an article in the newspaper and it talks about the “average” it usually means the mean but sometimes it refers to the median. Some articles will use the word “median” instead of “average” to be more specific. If you need to make an important decision and the information says “average”, it would be wise to ask if the “average” is the mean or the median before you decide.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose that a company wants to use the mean salary as the average salary for the company. This is because the high salaries of the administrators will pull the mean higher. The company can say that the employees are paid well because the average is high. However, the employees want to use the median since it discounts the extreme values of the administration and will give a lower value of the average. This will make the salaries seem lower and that a raise is in order.</p>
<p>Why use the mean instead of the median? The reason is because when multiple samples are taken from the same population, the sample means tend to be more consistent than other measures of the center.</p>
<p>To understand how the different measures of center related to skewed or symmetric distributions, see figure #3.1.2. As you can see sometimes the mean is smaller than the median, sometimes the mean is larger than the median, and sometimes they are the same values.</p>
<p><strong>Figure #3.1.2: Mean, Median, Mode as Related to a Distribution</strong> <img src="centers_distribution.png" alt="Graphs of symmetric, skewed right and skewed left" /></p>
<p>One last type of average is a weighted average. <strong>Weighted averages</strong> are used quite often in different situations. Some teachers use them in calculating a student’s grade in the course, or a grade on a project. Some employers use them in employee evaluations. The idea is that some activities are more important than others. As an example, a full time teacher at a community college may be evaluated on their service to the college, their service to the community, whether their paperwork is turned in on time, and their teaching. However, teaching is much more important than whether their paperwork is turned in on time. When the evaluation is completed, more weight needs to be given to the teaching and less to the paperwork. This is a weighted average.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Weighted Average</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\text{weighted average}=\frac{\sum{x*w}}{\sum{w}}\)</span></p>
<p>where <em>w</em> is the weight of the data value, <em>x</em>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Measures of Spread</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Variability is an important idea in statistics. If you were to measure the height of everyone in your classroom, every observation gives you a different value. That means not every student has the same height. Thus there is variability in people’s heights. If you were to take a sample of the income level of people in a town, every sample gives you different information. There is variability between samples too. Variability describes how the data are spread out. If the data are very close to each other, then there is low variability. If the data are very spread out, then there is high variability. How do you measure variability? It would be good to have a number that measures it. This section will describe some of the different measures of variability, also known as variation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In example #3.1.1, the average weight of a cat was calculated to be 2.72 kg. How much does this tell you about the weight of all cats? Can you tell if most of the weights were close to 2.72 kg or were the weights really spread out? The highest weight and the lowest weight are known, but is there more that you can tell? All you know is that the center of the weights is 2.72 kg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need more information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>range</strong> of a set of data is the difference between the highest and the lowest data values (or maximum and minimum values).</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="example-range" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Example: Range**</h3>
<p>From example #3.1.2, the maximum is 3.9 kg and the minimum is 2 kg. So the range is <span class="math inline">\(3.9-2=1.9 kg\)</span>. But what does that tell you? You don’t know if the weights are really spread out, or if they are close together.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, range doesn’t really provide a very accurate picture of the variability. A better way to describe how the data is spread out is needed. Instead of looking at the distance the highest value is from the lowest how about looking at the distance each value is from the mean. This distance is called the <strong>deviation</strong>. You might want to find the average of the deviation. Though the calculation for finding the average deviation is not very straight forward, you end up with a value called the ** variance **. The symbol for the population variance is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, and it is the average squared distance from the mean. Statisticians like the variance, but many other people who work with statistics use a descriptive statistics which is the square root of the variance. This gives you the average distance from the mean. This is called the standard deviation, and is denoted with the letter <em>s</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard deviation is the average (mean) distance from a data point to the mean. It can be thought of as how much a typical data point differs from the mean.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample variance</strong> formula: <span class="math inline">\(s^2=\frac{\sum\left(x-\bar{x}\right)^2}{n-1}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is the sample mean, <em>n</em> is the sample size, and $ means to find the sum of the data.</p>
<p>The <strong>sample standard deviation</strong> formula: <span class="math inline">\(s=\sqrt{ \frac{\sum\left(x-\bar{x}\right)^2}{n-1}}\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> on the bottom has to do with a concept called degrees of freedom. Basically, it makes the sample standard deviation a better approximation of the population standard deviation.</p>
<p>The <strong>population variance</strong> formula: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum\left(x-\mu \right)^2}{N}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the Greek letter sigma and represents the population variance, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the population mean, and N is the size of the population.</p>
<p>The <strong>population standard deviation</strong> formula: <span class="math inline">\(\sigma =\sqrt{ \frac{\sum\left(x-\mu \right)^2}{N}}\)</span></p>
<p>Both the sample variance and sample standard deviation can be found using technology. If using R Studio, you would use df_stats(~variable, data=data frame, var, sd).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can see that the mean weight of females cats is 2.36 kg, the variance is 0.075 <span class="math inline">\(kg^2\)</span>, and the standard deviation is 0.27 kg. For males cats, the mean is 2.9 kg, the variance is 0.22 <span class="math inline">\(kg^2\)</span>, and the standard deviation is 0.47 kg. This means that female cats weigh less than males and since the variance and standard deviations are much less for female cats than males cats, female cats’ weights are more consistent than male cats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general a “small” variance and standard deviation means the data is close together (more consistent) and a “large” variance and standard deviation means the data is spread out (less consistent). Sometimes you want consistent data and sometimes you don’t. As an example if you are making bolts, you want to lengths to be very consistent so you want a small standard deviation. If you are administering a test to see who can be a pilot, you want a large standard deviation so you can tell who are the good pilots and who are the not so good pilots.</p>
<p>What do “small” and “large” mean? To a bicyclist whose average speed is 20 mph, <em>s</em> = 20 mph is huge. To an airplane whose average speed is 500 mph, <em>s</em> = 20 mph is nothing. The “size” of the variation depends on the size of the numbers in the problem and the mean. Another situation where you can determine whether a standard deviation is small or large is when you are comparing two different samples such as in example #3.2.2. A sample with a smaller standard deviation is more consistent than a sample with a larger standard deviation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many other books and authors stress that there is a computational formula for calculating the standard deviation. However, this formula doesn’t give you an idea of what standard deviation is and what you are doing. It is only good for doing the calculations quickly. It goes back to the days when standard deviations were calculated by hand, and the person needed a quick way to calculate the standard deviation. It is an archaic formula that this author is trying to eradicate. It is not necessary anymore, computers will do the calculations for you with as much meaning as this formula gives. It is suggested that you never use it. If you want to understand what the standard deviation is doing, then you should use the definition formula. If you want an answer quickly, use a computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Use of Standard Deviation</strong></p>
<p>One of the uses of the standard deviation is to describe how a population is distributed. This describes where much of the data is for most distributions. A general rule is that about 95% of the data is within 2 standard deviations of the mean. This is not perfect, but is works for many distributions. There are rules like the empirical rule and Chebyshev’s theorem that give you more detailed percentages, but 95% in 2 standard deviations is a very good approximation.</p>

<p>The general rule says that about 95% of the data is within two standard deviations of the mean. That percentage is fairly high. There isn’t much data outside two standard deviations. A rule that can be followed is that if a data value is within two standard deviations, then that value is a common data value. If the data value is outside two standard deviations of the mean, either above or below, then the number is uncommon. It could even be called unusual. An easy calculation that you can do to figure it out is to find the difference between the data point and the mean, and then divide that answer by the standard deviation.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In 1974, there were 45 tornadoes in Oklahoma. Is this value unusual? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Variable: <em>x</em> = number of tornadoes in Oklahoma</p>
<p>To answer this question, first find how many standard deviations 45 is from the mean. From example #3.2.3, we know <span class="math inline">\(\mu=56\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=27.6\)</span>. For <em>x</em>=45, <span class="math inline">\(z=\frac{45-56}{27.6}=-0.399\)</span></p>
<p>Since this value is between -2 and 2, then it is not unusual to have 45 tornadoes in a year in Oklahoma. The z vlaue is negative, so that means that 45 is less than the mean number of tornadoes.</p>

<p>For this question the <em>x</em> = 145, <span class="math inline">\(z=\frac{145-56}{27.6}=3.22\)</span></p>

<p><strong>Code book for data frame Pulse</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description</strong> Students in an introductory statistics class (MS212 taught by Professor John Eccleston and Dr Richard Wilson at The University of Queensland) participated in a simple experiment. The students took their own pulse rate. They were then asked to flip a coin. If the coin came up heads, they were to run in place for one minute. Otherwise they sat for one minute. Then everyone took their pulse again. The pulse rates and other physiological and lifestyle data are given in the data.</p>
<p>Five class groups between 1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. The lecturer, Richard Wilson, was concerned that some students would choose the less strenuous option of sitting rather than running even if their coin came up heads, In the years 1995-1998 a different method of random assignment was used. In these years, data forms were handed out to the class before the experiment. The forms were pre-assigned to either running or non-running and there were an equal number of each. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned so the numbers running and sitting was still not entirely controlled.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong> The purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of Reiki as an adjuvant to opioid therapy in the management of pain. Since no studies in this area could be found, a pilot study was carried out involving 20 volunteers experiencing pain at 55 sites for a variety of reasons, including cancer. All Reiki treatments were provided by a certified second-degree Reiki therapist. Pain was measured using both a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a Likert scale immediately before and after the Reiki treatment. Both instruments showed a highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001) reduction in pain following the Reiki treatment.</p>
<p>This data frame contains the following columns:</p>
<p>vas.before: pain measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) before Reiki treatment</p>
<p>vas.after: pain measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) after Reiki treatment</p>

<p>Since the data was collected both and before and after the treatment for all of the units of observations, you want to look at the effect size of the treatment. You want to find the difference between before and after for the pain scale. First you must create a new data frame that adds a column for the difference in before and after. This data is known as paired data. To create the new column in a new data frame called Newreiki use the following commands</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Ranking</h2>
<p>Along with the center and the variability, another useful numerical measure is the ranking of a number. A <strong>percentile</strong> is a measure of ranking. It represents a location measurement of a data value to the rest of the values. Many standardized tests give the results as a percentile. Doctors also use percentiles to track a child’s growth.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>k</em>th percentile</strong> is the data value that has k% of the data at or below that value.</p>

<p>There are special percentiles called <strong>quartiles</strong>. Quartiles are numbers that divide the data into fourths. One fourth (or a quarter) of the data falls between consecutive quartiles.</p>
<p><strong>To find the quartiles:</strong></p>
<p>The command in R Studio is df_stats(~variable, data=data frame, summary)</p>
<p>If you record the quartiles together with the maximum and minimum you have five numbers. This is known as the five-number summary. The five-number summary consists of the minimum, the first quartile (<em>Q1</em>), the median, the third quartile (<em>Q3</em>), and the maximum (in that order).</p>
<p>The interquartile range, <em>IQR</em>, is the difference between the first and third quartiles, <em>Q1</em> and <em>Q3</em>. Half of the data (50%) falls in the interquartile range. If the <em>IQR</em> is “large” the data is spread out and if the <em>IQR</em> is “small” the data is closer together.</p>
<p>Interquartile Range (<em>IQR</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Determining probable outliers from IQR: </strong>fences**</p>
<p>A value that is less than (this value is often referred to as a <strong>low</strong> <strong>fence</strong>) is considered an outlier.</p>
<p>Similarly, a value that is more than (the <strong>high</strong> <strong>fence</strong>) is considered an outlier.</p>
<p>A boxplot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical display of the five-number summary. It can be drawn vertically or horizontally. The basic format is a box from <em>Q1</em> to <em>Q3</em>, a vertical line across the box for the median and horizontal lines as whiskers extending out each end to the minimum and maximum. The minimum and maximum can be represented with dots. Don’t forget to label the tick marks on the number line and give the graph a title.</p>
<p>An alternate form of a Boxplot, known as a modified box plot, only extends the left line to the smallest value greater than the <em>low fence</em>, and extends the left line to the largest value less than the <em>high fence</em>, and displays markers (dots, circles or asterisks) for each outlier.</p>
<p>If the data are <em>symmetrical</em>, then the box plot will be visibly symmetrical. If the data distribution has a left skew or a right skew, the line on that side of the box plot will be visibly long. If the plot is symmetrical, and the four quartiles are all about the same length, then the data are likely a near <em>uniform</em> distribution. If a box plot is symmetrical, and both outside lines are noticeably longer than the Q1 to median and median to Q3 distance, the distribution is then probably <em>bell-shaped.</em></p>

<p>Numerical descriptions might also be useful.

<blockquote>
<p>Since there are many dots outside the upper fence the data has many outliers. From all of this information, one could say that nerve pusles between successive pulses is around 11 1/50 second, with a spread of 19.5 1/50 second. Most of the values are round 11 1/50 second, but they are not very consistent. The density plot and boxplot show that there is a great deal of spread of the data and it is skewed to the right. This means mostly the speed is around 11 1/50 second, but there is a great deal of variability in the values.</p>
